  --> $DIR/issue-42796.rs:18:20

LL |     let s = "Hello!".to_owned();
   |         - move occurs because `s` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     let mut s_copy = s;
   |                      - value moved here
...
LL |     println!("{}", s);

help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
