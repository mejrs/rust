error[E0277]: cannot format `A` with format specifier `X`
  --> $DIR/fmt_traits.rs:20:25

LL |     format!("the thing: {a:X}");
   |                         ^^^^^

   = note: the format specifier `X` forwards to trait `UpperHex`, but `A` does not implement it
   = help: `A` implements the following formatting traits:
           `Display`, which can be invoked by omitting the format specifier
           `Debug`, which can be invoked with the `?` format specifier
           `Pointer`, which can be invoked with the `p` format specifier
